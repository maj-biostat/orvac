# ALL log all messages.
# DEBUG log all debug level messages and above.
# INFO log all informational level messages and above.
# WARN log all warning level messages and above.
# ERROR log all error level messages and above.
# FATAL log only fatal error messages.
# OFF disable logging.

# For general use leave profiling off.

# simulated dataset to have yielded a successful trial.
